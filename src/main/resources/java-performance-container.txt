Recommendations to run java app in container environment:

1) Container CPU - 2
2) Container Memory - 2--4GB
3) Heap Size - 75%
4) GC - Parallel

How to achieve above.
java --XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:MaxRamPercentage=75 -jar my-app.jar

It's better to have less number but bigger nodes than smaller more number of nodes, because Java scales well up than out.
